## Introduction

My project is a quiz about Superheroes from comics with a superhero aesthetic.  My goal was to give a very visually appealing moving quiz while also maintaining a high level of readability and clarity

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- jQuery

## Challenges

#### I have trouble with 
    Creating and formatting the framework for the entire quiz.  My css skills needed a bit more sharpening but ultimately it looks great to me.
    The header and flex were giving me problems.  The spacing and margins between the header elements were a bit annoying but ultimately I found the best way to solve it was to put them all in the same div to space them out better.  Struggling understanding some Jquery as we go.

    The answer hover effects have a random blinking effect and I don't know hwo to get rid of it.  I did some simple animations and also found a really clean line of code that gives a similar effect at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPcvAwp71uA.

    Another idea that came up was the idea of the character or subject being revealed under every hover option.  It sounded as hard as it was.  Making decisions about what to use and what would be the most efficient was really difficult but in the end I decided to completed rewrite the data from contentful I was grabbing, to include URL's to the picture I would need along side the answers for the questions. 

    I also worked on a modal that comes up every time you get a correct or incorrect answer.  My css skills were tested once more heavily. It was not able to work so I put it off for a bit and came back to it later.

    My answers boxes were constantly being updated due to issues with compatiability of effects I used on top of each other as well.

    My site is mobile friendly however the pictures don't always line up correctly and it's been difficult trying to line them up all at their focal point.  I should've used more centered pictures

###The good parts

    The media query usage was actually somewhat fun when dealing with a certain phone type.  It felt like creating a new site essentially with these new limitations that made me feel more likely to try new things.

    The look of the page is very reminiscent of older superhero comics.  I wished I made the header a bit more interesting but I think it does its job as of right now.
