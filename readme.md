## Introduction

My project is a quiz about Superheroes from comics with a superhero aesthetic.  My goal was to give a very visually appealing moving quiz while also maintaining a high level of readability and clarity

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- jQuery

## Challenges

#### I have trouble with 
    Creating and formatting the framework for the entire quiz.  My css skills needed a bit more sharpening but ultimately it looks great to me.
    The header and flex were giving me problems.  The spacing and margins between the header elements were a bit annoying but ultimately I found the best way to solve it was to put them all in the same div to space them out better.  Struggling understanding some Jquery as we go.

    The answer hover effects have a random blinking effect and I don't know hwo to get rid of it.  I did some simple animations and also found a really clean line of code that gives a similar effect at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPcvAwp71uA.

    Ended up using that but want to do way more cool animation tricks.
